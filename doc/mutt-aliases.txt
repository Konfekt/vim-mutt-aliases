0. Usage ~

This plug-in lets you complete mutt aliases (listed in ~/.mutt/aliases) inside
Vim; useful when using Vim as editor for mutt (especially with $edit_headers).
(See also the shell script https://github.com/Konfekt/mutt-alias.sh to populate
the aliases file with recent e-mail addresses in your Inbox or Sent folder).

When you're editing a mail file in Vim that reads
>
    From: Lu Guanqun <guanqun.lu@gmail.com>
    To:   foo
<
and in your mutt aliases file there is an entry
>
    alias foo foo@bar.com
<
and your cursor is right after `foo`, then hit `Ctrl+X Ctrl+U` to obtain:
>
    From: Lu Guanqun <guanqun.lu@gmail.com>
    To:   foo@bar.com
<

===========================================================================
1. Commands ~

The command :*EditAliases* opens the mutt aliases file in Vim.
For less typing, you can (command-line) alias it to ea by
https://github.com/Konfekt/vim-alias

To complete e-mail addresses inside Vim press CTRL-X CTRL-U in insert
mode. See |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U| and |compl-function|.

===========================================================================
2. Setup ~

The mutt aliases file is automatically set to the value of the variable
`$alias_file` in the file `~/.muttrc`. To explicitly set the path to a mutt
aliases file $file, add to your `.vimrc` the line
>
  let g:muttaliases_file = '$file'
<
For example, $file could be
>
  ~/.mutt/aliases
<

3. Related ~

To add aliases for all e-mail addresses found in a mail dir, such as the
INBOX, there is the shell script https://github.com/Konfekt/mutt-alias.sh ;
best run by a, say weekly, (ana)cronjob.

The plugin https://github.com/Konfekt/vim-mailquery lets you complete e-mail
addresses in Vim by those in your Inbox (or any other mail folder).
